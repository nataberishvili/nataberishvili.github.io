### Data Science Portfolio by Nata Berishvili

This portfolio is a collection of notebooks which I created for data analysis and machine learning projects for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.


# Exploratory Data Analysis - Medicare

For this project I use Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare paments. I explore and visualize data to make comparisons between individual hospital-level charges and payments within local markets, and nationwide. (#R #dplyr #ggplot2)

# Predicting Loan Default

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nataberishvili/nataberishvili.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
