## Data Science Portfolio by Nata Berishvili

This portfolio is a collection of notebooks which I created for data analysis and machine learning projects for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.


## Exploratory Data Analysis - Medicare

For this project I use Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare paments. I explore and visualize data to make comparisons between individual hospital-level charges and payments within local markets, and nationwide. (#R #dplyr #ggplot2)

`usstates1 <- payment %>%
  group_by(Provider.State) %>% filter(Year == 2017) %>%
  summarize(totalcost = sum(Average.Covered.Charges, na.rm =TRUE))%>%
  mutate(percent = (totalcost/sum(totalcost))*100)%>%
  arrange(desc(totalcost))`

```markdown
usstates1 <- payment %>%
  group_by(Provider.State) %>% filter(Year == 2017) %>%
  summarize(totalcost = sum(Average.Covered.Charges, na.rm =TRUE))%>%
  mutate(percent = (totalcost/sum(totalcost))*100)%>%
  arrange(desc(totalcost))





```
