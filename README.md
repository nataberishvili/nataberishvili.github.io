# Data Science Portfolio by Nata Berishvili

This portfolio is a collection of notebooks which I created for data analysis and machine learning projects.


### Happiness Around the World - Data Visualization with R


The data was scraped from the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report).
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Happiness is explained by 6 factors. As per the 2019 Happiness Index, Finland is the happiest country in the world.

### Exploratory Data Analysis - Medicare


For this project I use Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare paments. I explore and visualize data to make comparisons between the individual hospital-level charges and payments within local markets, and nationwide. 
Questions I want to answer 

- Which Diagnostic Related Groups cost Medicare the most?
- What are the most commong hospital discharges? 
- What is the trend in last 3 years?
- Which States and Hospitals charge the most? etc.

### Predicting Loan Default - Binary Classification

For this project I specifically focus less on feature engineering and use a small dataset. The main purpose is to build supervised machine learning models with h2o and experiment with hyperparameters.
For more details code can be found here [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/nataberishvili/h2o_rf_gbm_stacked_ensambles_loan_default/blob/master/h2o-rf-gbm-stacked.ipynb).



### Explain Loan Probability of Default With SHAP Values

Some models are easy to interpret such as linear / logistic regression (weight on each feature, knowing the exact contribution and negative and positive interaction), single decision trees, some models are harder to interpret such as Ensemble models - it is hard to understand the role of each feature, it comes with "feature importance" but does not tell if feature affects decision positively or negatively
